ABout the Project:-
This project aims to predict whether a product will be returned based on customer behavior and transaction context. Using a machine learning classification approach, we analyze three key factors: the purchase amount, the review score given by the customer, and the number of days it took for the product to be delivered.

The objective is to help e-commerce platforms reduce return-related costs by identifying potentially returnable orders ahead of time. A Random Forest Classifier was implemented to perform the classification, and model performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this model provides a step toward smarter logistics and customer experience management.
ALGORITH USED:-
The algorithm used in your project is:

Random Forest Classifier
ðŸ”§ Why Random Forest?
It's an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees.

It reduces overfitting and improves accuracy compared to a single decision tree.

It works well with both numerical and categorical data.

It's robust and provides good feature importance insights.

How It Works:
It builds several decision trees on different random subsets of the data.

Each tree gives a prediction, and the final output is based on majority voting (for classification).

This leads to better generalization on unseen data.
